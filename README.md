This extension adds OMNeT++ MSG and NED language support for the [Zed editor](https://zed.dev/).
It uses the [NED](https://github.com/omnetpp/tree-sitter-ned) and [MSG](https://github.com/omnetpp/tree-sitter-msg) tree-sitter grammars.

----------

Currently, the extension can only be installed locally, i.e., it isn't in the Zed extension repository. To install locally:

- Clone this repository
- In Zed, select `Extensions`/`Install Dev Extension`, and select the `omnetpp-zed` folder
